{"name":"Facile-api","tagline":"The Facile API is capable of reading (decompiling) .Net assemblies. Covering the metadata tables, the embedded types and methods, including their bodies as CIL (bytecode).","body":"## Background\r\nInitially the Facile API has been written to perform analysis of .Net assemblies, independent of the authoring .Net language.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nPlease make a donation if you like it:\r\n\r\n[![https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4XAU6DKYLW7VA](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4XAU6DKYLW7VA)\r\n\r\n## Code Sample\r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n    //specify a path, where to find the assembly\r\n    String assemblyName = \"mscorlib.dll\";\r\n    String assemblyLocation = \"../path/to/assembly/\" + assemblyName;\r\n\r\n    //reflect and load the assembly using the Facile factory\r\n    Assembly assembly = Facile.loadAssembly(assemblyLocation);\r\n                \r\n    //perform your custom operations on the assembly...\r\n    System.out.println(\"All defined types in \" + assemblyName + \":\\n\");\r\n    for(Type type : assembly.getAllTypes()) {\r\n        System.out.println(type);\r\n    }\r\n} catch (Exception e) {\r\n    e.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Current Focus\r\n * Bug issue#4 has been partially resolved with r77, but there is still some work to do (to be solved until 1.0.4).\r\n * Fix all FIXME and TODO's in the code base\r\n * IL Source Renderer for round tripping: basic version, but pretty poor\r\n * C# Renderer: not implementation so far\r\n * Moving from Java6 to Java8\r\n\r\n### Other Issues\r\n * FacileReader (RCP using the Facile API): There is an alpha version of that, see download section (still using API version 1.0.2). I might do a total re-write without Eclipse/RCP because of several plugin issues.\r\n\r\n * Running CIL code in Java, emulating the VES: internal idea, collecting more infromation...\r\n * Code analysis for uncaught exception: internal idea, collecting more infromation...\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n * The most recent stable API version as Java archive \r\n   (even though the master/trunk can be always seen as stable):\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/TomSmartBishop/facile-api/blob/1.0.3/Facile/at.pollaknet.api.facile_1.0.3.jar\r\n\r\n * Using the Facile API for a decompiler application - FacileReader (alpha):\r\n\r\n   http://facile-api.googlecode.com/files/FacileReader.zip\r\n\r\n### Commercial Use\r\nThe Facile API is commercially used by the Sonargraph Explorer: http://www.hello2morrow.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-26399209-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
